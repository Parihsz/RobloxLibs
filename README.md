RobloxLibs is a collection of reusable modules I created while developing my game.
They are: 
* Mostly lightweight (Some of Redblox's Libraries are packaged into them and can be easily moved out). They are single file modules.
* The performance sensitive ones (like Grid) have been optimized as much as possible. Though keep in mind they are modified to be more generalized for open source and can be optimized further for your specific usecase.
* The API was made to be easy to understand, use and can fit in most codebases.
* Fully typed with ``--!strict``

Please make an issue or PR if you find any problems or message me on discord.
